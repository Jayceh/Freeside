=head1 NAME

FS::part_pkg::prorate_Mixin - Mixin class for part_pkg:: classes that 
need to prorate partial months

=head1 SYNOPSIS

package FS::part_pkg::...;
use base qw( FS::part_pkg::prorate_Mixin );

sub calc_recur {
  ...
  if( conditions that trigger prorate ) {
    # sets $$sdate and $param->{'months'}, returns the prorated charge
    $charges = $self->calc_prorate($cust_pkg, $sdate, $param, $cutoff_day);
  } 
  ...
}

=head METHODS

=item calc_prorate CUST_PKG SDATE DETAILS PARAM CUTOFF_DAY

Takes all the arguments of calc_recur.  Calculates a prorated charge from 
the $sdate to the cutoff day for this package definition, and sets the $sdate 
and $param->{months} accordingly.  base_recur() will be called to determine 
the base price per billing cycle.

Options:
- add_full_period: Bill for the time up to the prorate day plus one full
  billing period after that.
- prorate_round_day: Round the current time to the nearest full day, 
  instead of using the exact time.
- prorate_defer_bill: Don't bill the prorate interval until the prorate 
  day arrives.
- prorate_verbose: Generate details to explain the prorate calculations.

set, in which case it postpones the next bill to the cutoff day.

Given a current time and a day of the month to prorate to, return three 
times: the start of the prorate interval (usually the current time), the
end of the prorate interval (i.e. the cutoff date), and the time one month 
before the end of the prorate interval.
